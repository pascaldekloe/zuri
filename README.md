# ZURI

## About

… a library for strict URI handling, written in the Zig programming language.

No stable release yet. 🚧 I'm still learning the language.

## Interface

Run `make doc` to see the full interface documentation at `doc/index.html'.


### Parse

```zig
// Parse returns a mapping of s if and only if s is a valid URI.
fn parse(s: []const u8) ParseError!Parts
```

Parts contains a lossless decomposition with all URI components as is.

```zig
// The scheme component ends with ‘:’. It may contain upper-case letters.
raw_scheme: []const u8,

// The authority component, if any, starts with “//”.
raw_authority: []const u8 = "",

// The userinfo component, if any, ends with ‘@’.
raw_userinfo: []const u8 = "",

// The host component can be a registered name, or an IP address.
raw_host: []const u8 = "",

// The port component, if any, starts with ‘:’.
raw_port: []const u8 = "",

// The path compoment, if any, starts with ‘/’ when the URI has an authority component.
raw_path: []const u8 = "",

// The query compoment, if any, starts with ‘?’.
raw_query: []const u8 = "",

// The fragment component, if any, starts with ‘#’.
raw_fragment: []const u8 = "",
```

Components have dedicated methods to resolved and/or compare values, like:

```zig
// Fragment returns the value with any and all percent-encodings resolved.
fn fragment(p: *const Parts, m: std.mem.Allocator) error{OutOfMemory}![]u8

// HasFragment returns whether a fragment component is present, and whether its
// value with any and all percent-encodings resolved equals match.
fn hasFragment(p: *const Parts, match: []const u8) bool
```

### Format

URI construction goes by type as each format has its own constraints.

```zig
// NewUrl returns a valid URL/URI.
fn newUrl(comptime scheme: []const u8, userinfo: ?[]const u8, hostname: []const u8, port: ?u16, path_segs: []const []const u8, m: Allocator) error{OutOfMemory}![]u8
```

```zig
/// NewUrn returns a valid URN/URI. The specifics string must be valid UTF-8.
/// An upper-case prefix ("URN:") is returned if and only namespace contains
/// upper-case letters exclusively. The escape_set opts in percent-encoding for
/// octets in the specifics string which would otherwise get included as is,
/// namely 'A'—'Z', 'a'—'z', '0'—'9', '-', '.', '_', '~', '!', '$', '&', '\'',
/// '(', ')', '*', '+', ',', ';', '=', ':', '@' and '/'.
pub fn newUrn(comptime namespace: []const u8, specifics: []const u8, comptime escape_set: []const u8, m: Allocator) error{ OutOfMemory, NotUtf8 }![]u8
```

```zig
pub const QueryParam = struct {
    key: []const u8,
    value: ?[]const u8 = null,
};

/// AddParamsAndOrFragment returns a new URI with the query parameters and/or a
/// fragment appended to the input URI. Caller owns the result.
///
/// When params is not empty, then a query component is added conform the
/// defactor application/x-www-form-urlencoded standard. Note that spaces are
/// replaced by a plus ("+") character. The equals ("=") character is omitted
/// when a value is null.
pub fn addParamsAndOrFragment(uri: []const u8, params: []const QueryParam, fragment: ?[]const u8, m: Allocator) error{OutOfMemory}![]u8
```


## Benchmark

The following results were measured on an Apple M1. Run `make bench.out` to see
on your machine.

```
URL construction with host and 3-segment path took 152 on average, including free
parse http://www.example.com/path/to%20a/long-name took 30 ns on average
```
